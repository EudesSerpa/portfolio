	Young Colombian graduated in Electronic Engineering from the University of
	Magdalena and passionate about software development. Currently, studying
	a technologist in the area of Software Analysis and Development at the
	National Learning Service, SENA (for its acronym in Spanish).
	---
	My first approach to programming and software development was during my first
	semester of undergraduate, where I had the opportunity to familiarize myself
	with the C programming language and the Arduino microcontroller. Although it
	was a challenging start, I discovered a genuine passion for these areas.
	---
	Over the past few years, I have invested countless hours in studying
	and practicing various programming languages,	frameworks and web
	technologies. This dedication has allowed me to acquire solid
	knowledge in web development and embedded systems.
	---
	If you're looking for a committed, self-taught and enthusiastic professional
	who can bring a unique perspective and solid technical skills to your team,
	I'd love the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your project!`,
